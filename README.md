# IMDB-Movie-Analysis
When it comes to watching a movie or series, most of us first go to google and search about IMDB ratings of the interested movies or series. And this project is about IMDB movie Analysis. Before starting the project, it is important to know a few things about IMDB, like what it is and how it works.
IMDB stands for Internet Movie Database, an online database that stores information about films, television series, podcasts, video games and online streaming content. It also includes cast, production crew, plot summaries, ratings and fan and critical reviews. Since 1998, it has been owned and operated by one of the subsidiaries of Amazon, IMDb.com Inc.
In this project, we will analyze the IMDb movie rating and find useful insights. 

PROJECT DESCRIPTION

There are some extra information in the dataset that is not required, like actor2_name, director_facebook_like, color, etc.
We need to answer the questions and derive insights using this dataset.
